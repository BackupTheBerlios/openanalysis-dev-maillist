<PRE>========
July 17-21
========

Everyone is really cranking, and I am seeing a lot of work being  
accomplished.  Great job everyone!

Accomplishments for last week
-------------------------------------------
- Andy fixed bug #8068 &quot;GenOutputTool chokes on  
OA_ptr&lt;std::set&lt;IRHandle&gt; &gt;&quot; and related bug #8130
- Andy added flags --skipAnalysis and --exitWithTop as command-line  
options in UseOA-ROSE
- Andy figured out the memory problem with alias analysis on the  
smg2000.  He needed to uncomment the delete statement in OA_ptr,  
which is currently commented out awaiting the graph refactor.
- Barbara got ManagerICFGDep working and set up regression tests for  
it?  Actually Barbara where are the regression tests?
- Barbara cleaned up some of the OutputBuilderDOT implementation and  
added the concept of a subgraph to the OutputBuilder interface.
- Barbara found and fixed a wicked subtle bug in the graph classes!! =)
- Brian and Michelle discussed refactoring findAllMemRefExprs in  
OAWraps at length.
- Luis finished testing his Linearity analysis data structure.
- Priya, with help from Barbara, finished SideEffect analysis.  Many  
weird bugs in here thanks to yours truly.
- Priya refactored the CallGraph data-flow framework.
- Priya translated the old wiki docs from html to latex, but Michelle  
has yet to look at the results. =)
- Priya set up regression testing for Reaching Definitions.
- Priya found an apartment!  Barbara drove her around and helped a  
lot, thanks!

Goals for this week
-------------------------------------------
- Andy and Brian are going to discuss compiling whole programs in  
ROSE with Dan.
- Barbara aims to get ManagerICFGUseful working, which will require  
adding some extra functionality to ParamBindings and LocDFSet wrt  
translating locations from the callee to caller and vice versa.
- Luis aims to get his Linearity data structures compiling in  
OpenAnalysis and working with the Location data structure.  Also,  
Luis aims to start putting together a benchmarks suite for linearity  
analysis.
- Priya aims to refactor the CFG data-flow framework to be like the  
ICFG data-flow framework.  Trickier than the CallGraph refactor.
- Michelle aims to pass off the graph refactor prototype to Priya by  
the end of the week.

Plan for Fixing Bugs
-------------------------------------------
- BTW, I noticed that we were posting most our bugs to UseOA-ROSE,  
even though bugs for things like the GenOutputTool belong in the  
OpenAnalysis bug list.  Just something to keep in mind.  I have been  
the biggest culprit.
- Bug #8133 (Improper modeling of pass-by-reference), for now we can  
wait until Michelle does the findAllMemRefExprs refactor
- I am STILL working on some FIAliasAliasMap issues especially  
related to dereferences to formals being mapped to Unknown.  My fixes  
broke one regression test and I just don't have time to check it in.

New Docs and Procedures
-------------------------------------------
- For consistency, please do NOT put the following line from the  
ChangeLog into the svn log entry:
