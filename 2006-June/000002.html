<PRE>Hello all,

We are going to start using the bug databases in all three projects.

Are first example was a bug involving commas in UseOA-ROSE.  Andy  
fixed the bug in rev 66.  Thanks Andy!

 From now on, here is the procedure for reporting and/or fixing a bug.

Reporting a bug
	1) Put the bug in bug tracking.  In the detailed description,  
indicate the specific TestCases/ file that causes the bug to occur.

	2) Send email to <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/openanalysis-dev">openanalysis-dev at lists.berlios.de</A> suggesting who  
you think might best be able to fix the bug.  If it is yourself, then  
estimate how long it might take.

Reporting a fixed bug
	1) Create at least one regression test that shows the bug is fixed.   
Make sure that test is in a .test file.  Make sure that the  
corresponding .script file is called in scripts/regressAll.script.   
Add the input and output files to the repository.

	2) Mark that the bug has been fixed in the database

	3) Send email to the mailing list.

I have done steps 1, 2, and consider this 3 for Andy's fix of the  
comma bug.

This might appear somewhat involved, but it really isn't that bad.   
Also, such procedures are critical when we are dealing with such a  
large group of people working in the same code.  Starting Monday we  
will have 6 people total (Andy, Brian, Barbara, Luis, Priya, and  
myself) touching the code on a daily basis.

The other thing to keep in mind is that I don't expect you to report  
every little bug you find in your working copy.  Report bugs that  
someone else needs to fix or are going to cause you to make a non- 
trivial change to the trunk.

Cheers,
Michelle
