<PRE>Priya and Michelle,

Regarding [ Bug #8130 ] &quot;GenOutputTool giving syntax error&quot;.

We've encountered this issue before (Brian discovered it back in
March, Michelle, you should have a Mar 9 e-mail &quot;GenOutputTool can't
handle certain types&quot; which discusses this).

Anyway the reason why this bug is coming up is because the way
genOutputTool works is very naive, it doesn't take into account
typedefs.

Fixing the current version of genOutputTool to get around this issue
would be incredibly difficult.  It might be possible to scan a single
file for all tyepedefs, keeping a record of of them as encountered but
things get much more tricky when the typedef is declared in another
header (and I don't even want to think about how scoping would play
into all of this).

Anyways Priya,
This is really bad style, sorry :-(, but for now you should be able to
get around this issue by rewriting line 206 to be:

GENOUT std::map&lt;ProcHandle,OA_ptr&lt;OA::SideEffect::SideEffectStandard&gt;
&gt;<i>  mProcToSideEffectMap;
</I>
Thanks,
-Andy
