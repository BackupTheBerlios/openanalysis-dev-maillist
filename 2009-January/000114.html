At this point I would categorize the connection between OA and ROSE  
(UseOA-ROSE) as a work in progress.

</I>
Yes it is difficult to find a good tool.  If you want a C++ source-to- 
source tool that can handle most of C++ then ROSE might be your best  
bet.  The analysis piece is still being developed, therefore it  
probably is not as robust as you would like right now.

OA could hook up to LLVM but it doesn't.  Analysis in general should  
be easier in LLVM because the representation is lower-level  
(essentially typed 3-address code).  It might be difficult to do  
source-to-source compilation with LLVM.

If you find a tool that satisfies your requirements fully, please let  
me know.  =)

Cheers,
-Michelle
