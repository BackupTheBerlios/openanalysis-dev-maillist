<PRE>Priya,

These are all very good questions, so I am going to send the answer  
to the whole group.

&gt;<i> Hi Michelle,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have a basic question...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We use SubSetRef to represent Partial Accuracy.
</I>
The way we have been talking about it, it does seem that that is the  
case.  There are actually two concepts here.  One is are we accessing  
only part of a location or the full location.  The other concept is  
are we representing the access will full accuracy.  In the old setup  
when we had the full accuracy field, we were overloading that field  
to mean subset when we had an array access like A[i].  We were  
modeling that array access with a NamedRef with partial accuracy.   
That partial accuracy was then being interpreted both as we weren't  
representing the access with full accuracy and that we should treat  
it as accessing some unknown subset of the location the MRE  
accessed.  In the new setup, we are completely getting rid of the  
fullAccuracy field.  Now if we see something like A[4] we can  
represent it in two ways: as a SubSetRef(NamedRef(A)) or as an  
IdxAccess(4,NamedRef(A)).  The semantics of the SubSetRef is that it  
means some unknown subset of the MRE is being accessed.  Therefore  
the SubSetRef instance represent partial accuracy as well as  
referencing a subset.  IdxAccess, FieldAccess, and other subclasses  
for SubSetRef have full accuracy, but still represent some kind of  
subset operation.

&gt;<i> FieldAccess and IdxAccess are subclasses of SubSetRef.
</I>&gt;<i> FieldAccess &quot;is a SubSetRef&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> Thus, it should always have partial accuracy.
</I>
Based on the interpretation I give above, no.

&gt;<i> I am thinking what would be the equivalent representation for
</I>&gt;<i> a. FieldAccess with full accuracy in the following case: ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 
</I>&gt;<i> ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 
</I>&gt;<i> -
</I>&gt;<i> FieldAccess( DEF, ...., someRef, full)
</I>&gt;<i> ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 
</I>&gt;<i> ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 
</I>&gt;<i> -
</I>
FieldAccess(DEF, ..., someRef)

You don't need the full accuracy field anymore.

&gt;<i> b. Is it valid to think as FieldAccess with fullAccuracy ?
</I>
Yes.

&gt;<i> c. Should we just create instance of FieldAccess for above case ?
</I>
I am not sure what you mean by the &quot;above case&quot;.

&gt;<i> If that is true, then Wouldn't that create a confusion to recognize
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> a.  SubSetRef (for partial accuracy)
</I>&gt;<i> b.  FieldAccess with full Accuracy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think if we get instance of FieldAccess with fullAccuracy
</I>&gt;<i> and ask if( mre-&gt;isaSubSetRef() ), we would get answer = &quot;yes&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> and we may interpret wrong that mre has partial Accuracy.
</I>
Good point.  Notice however that not doing further investigation to  
see if the SubSetRef is really a FieldAccess instance will still  
result in conservatively correct results.  Assuming a subset access  
is partially accurate is always an correct conservative assumption.


&gt;<i> d. While creating instance of SubSetRef class should we
</I>&gt;<i>     ignore instances of FieldAccess. ?
</I>
If you have something like &quot;x.fieldname&quot;, then you can create a  
SubSetRef or a FieldAccess, but not both.  If a field access has  
already been created then stick with that.
