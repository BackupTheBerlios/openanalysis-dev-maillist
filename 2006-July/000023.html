<PRE>Hello all,

Yesterday I posted bug 008060 to OpenAnalysis.  The attached file  
nested-multipleInheritance-diffconst.cpp shows what is causing this  
bug.  It is a combination of nested classes, a convoluted class  
hierarchy with multiple inheritance, and constructors that take a  
parameter.  If I remove the class nesting or get rid of the DG class  
(which models DGStandard), or only have default constructors, the  
problem goes away.  I would like to propose temporarily solving this  
bug by commenting out the delete mPtr in OA_ptr.hpp.  This means that  
OA will start leaking memory all over the place.  Andy will want to  
uncomment it so that memory problems don't affect his performance.

I also propose we solve this bug by refactoring the graph classes.  I  
have finally had it with these classes, and with Priya on board I am  
willing to do a rewrite.  I have attached a prototype class hierarchy  
both in UML form and in C++ code that actually compiles.  Note that  
the Edge classes will have the same inheritance relationship that is  
shown on the Node classes.  The approach will be that Priya will  
create a branch to do the refactor.  When she has it tested with a  
TestGraph class (would have inheritance relationships similar to  
CFG), she will bring in all the regression tests we currently have  
and make sure that those work.  Therefore, if you want to make sure  
your stuff works the same after the refactor, then add more  
regression tests.

Any comments or suggestions are welcome.  I don't plan on having  
Priya start this until the end of the week.  I plan on putting more  
info about this on the wiki as I make progress through my code  
inspection of the current system.

Thanks,
Michelle

&quot;g++ DGraph-ver1.cpp&quot; should compile as long as you download both  
files and put them in the same dir.
