<PRE>Hi,

I've just checked in a revision that fixes three bugs:

- Abort on cout &lt;&lt; endl reported by Andy.
- [Bug #7963] Deref of &quot;this&quot; being passed as implicit param.
- [Bug #7962] Member fields, methods, and functions should be non-local.

I've also made some revisions to the staticVirtualMethodResolver, which
should now be ready for prime time.  Unfortunately, to work correctly
(though not to compile), this requires changes to ROSE.  I have made these
changes locally and will send to Dan for the next release.  Until someone
needs to use this (and I suspect you won't), don't worry about the mods to
ROSE.

Brian

6/28/06   UseOA-ROSE svn tag trunk r92  Brian White
        - Modified isMethodCall so that it returns false for
          static method calls.  isMethodCall is used to determine
          whether we need to pass an implicit &quot;this&quot; to model a
          method.  We don't need to do this (and can't) for a static
          method call.
        - Modified SageIRInterface::toString(const OA::CallHandle h)
          to output a function call which is an invocation of a copy
          constructor implicitly called by a return.
        - I started working on handling of special methods (next
	  entry).  However, Dan wanted this behavior in ROSE so that
	  it could be &quot;enjoyed&quot; by any ROSE analysis.  Therefore, I
	  have commented out my implementation of this behavior.
	  Note that it was not finished.  See comments that look like:
          // Support for special methods, which is now handled in ROSE.
        [ Handling of compiler-generated default constructors, copy
          constructors, destructors, and operator=.

	  - Modified getAliasStmtType to return PTR_ASSIGN_STMT when:
            1.  stmt is operator= and one of the implicitly invoked
                operator= along the call chain (if any) would
                implicitly copy a point.
                NB:  the default behavior of operator= is to do a
                     memberwise copy.
            2.  stmt invokes a copy constructor:
	        NB:  the default behavior of a copy constructor is
                     to perform memberwise copy.
                a.  case Foo *f = new Foo(*someOtherFoo) is already
                    handled by SgAssignOp case, which always returns
                    PTR_ASSIGN_STMT.
                b.  case Foo f(someOtherFoo) is handled by
                    SgVariableDeclaration case which returns true
                    whenever an object is declared.
                c.  case f(someOtherFoo) within a copy constructor.
	            Return PTR_ASSIGN_STMT if some compiler-generated
                    copy constructor invoked prior to a user-defined
                    copy constructor would implicitly copy a ptr
                    field (i.e., it's class has (non-method) pointer
members).
	    3.  destructors.  Since a default destructor would not
                implicit perform pointer assignments, we don't need to
                model anything here.
            4.  default (i.e., zero-arg) constructor.  Same as destructor
	        case.
         ]
	 - In CtoA set the excludeInputFiles to true for the
	   SageIRProcIterator.  This prevents us from generating output
	   for include files, such as iostream.h
	   bool excludeInputFiles = true;
           procIter = new SageIRProcIterator(sageProject, irInterface,
excludeInputFiles);
         - Changes to staticVirtualMethodResolver
	   - Needed to change
ClassHierarchyWrapper::ClassHierarchyWrapper,
	     which was not discovering all SgClassDefinitions, because
	     it was querying only for SgClassDefinition and some of these
             are not visited by default traversals/queries.  The example
	     is from Pande.C.  Unfortunately, this is external to
	     UseOA and needs to be passed to Dan for checkin to ROSE.
                // Unfortunately, SgClassDefinitions are not always
visited by
                // query and traversal mechanisms.  Consider this example:
                //  class Base {
                //  public:
                //    virtual void foo() { }
                //    virtual void bar() { }
                //    virtual void baz() { }
                //  } *a, *b, *p, *q;
                // The SgClassDefinition for Base only shows up in the
                // SgVariableDeclarations of *a, *b, etc.  Therefore, we
need
                // to query the SgVariableDeclarations as well.
           - Replaced methodOverridesVirtualMethod with
             matchingMemberFunctions, which properly compares two
             method type signatures.
	   - Allow dot expression involving a reference lhs to
             be examined as potential dynamic dispatch sites,
             rather than just pointer receivers.
	   - This should now be ready for the big time.
         - Fixed the following bug reported by Andy on June 8th.

           From: &quot;Andy Stone&quot; &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/openanalysis-dev">aistone at gmail.com</A>&gt;
           Date: June 8, 2006 11:01:11 AM MDT

           Subject: FIAliasAliasMap fails with 'variable &lt;&lt; endl'

           Michelle,

           The FiAliasAliasMap algorithm doesn't seem able to handle any
           situation where a variable is passed to an I/O object and endl
is
           passed immediatly after or immediatly before this variable.&#160;
For
           instance:&#160; cout &lt;&lt; variable &lt;&lt; endl.



           Error Message:

           $ ./OATest -edg:w --oa-FIAliasAliasMap -c breakuseoa.cpp
           OATest: Sage2OA.C:6886: virtual
           OA::OA_ptr&lt;OA::IRCallsiteParamIterator&gt;
           SageIRInterface::getCallsiteParams(OA::ExprHandle): Assertion
           `isMemRefNode(lhs)' failed.
           Aborted



           I've tried a few other cases to see if I can't determine
exactly
           what
           reproduces this problem.&#160; For instance

           These work:
           -&#160; cout &lt;&lt; variable;
           -&#160; cout &lt;&lt; variable &lt;&lt; &quot; string constant &quot; &lt;&lt; endl;
           -&#160; cout &lt;&lt; endl &lt;&lt; &quot; string constant &quot; &lt;&lt; variable

           These don't (they reproduce the error):
           -&#160; cout &lt;&lt; variable &lt;&lt; endl;
           -&#160; cout &lt;&lt; endl &lt;&lt; variable;
           -&#160; cerr &lt;&lt; variable &lt;&lt; endl;


           I've been playing around with GDB trying to see if I can't
figure
           out
           exactly what's causing this issue.&#160; Let me know if you have any
           ideas.

           Thanks,
           -Andy

           Fix: isMemRefNode(functionCallExp) was aborting for
	   ostream &amp;ostream::operator&lt;&lt; and friends, because
	   SageIRInterface::returnsAddress was not doing the correct
           thing.  isMemRefNode should return type for a function/method
           that returns a pointer or reference.  However, returnsAddress
           (called by isMemRefNode) was looking at
functionCallExp-&gt;get_type().
           I believe in a previous version of ROSE this return the
           type of the function call expression.  Now it is
           return a SgFunctionType.  I corrected returnsAddress
           to expect a SgFunctionType.
        - Fixed [Bug #7963] Deref of &quot;this&quot; being passed as implicit
param.
	  Added a regression test invokeBaseCtor.C in TestCase/CtoOA
          and corresponding {regress,gen}CtoOA.test files.
          Bug log:

Summary: Deref of &quot;this&quot; being passed as implicit param

Details: ./CtoOA TestCases/AliasTests/parambinds-formals.C

    PARAMBINDPTRASSIGNPAIRS = { CallHandle(&quot;SubClass&quot;) =&gt;
        [
            &lt; 0, Deref( DEF, NamedRef( USE,
SymHandle(&quot;this::SubSubClass::SubSubClass__SubSubClass__scope__SubSubClass____MF
b_SubSubClass__Fb_v_Gb___Rb__Base__Re____sep____Rb__i__Re___Fe_&quot;), F,
full), 1,
T, part) &gt;
            &lt; 1, NamedRef( USE, SymHandle(&quot;par&quot;), F, full) &gt;
        ] }

The zeroth parameter should be a NamedRef to this, not a Deref.

Comment:

Fix is in SageIRMemRefIterator::findAllMemRefsAndMemRefExprs and will be
committed in UseOA rev81 (or my next release thereafter if someone beats
me to
the punch).

See case V_SgIniitliazedName.  Problem was that I assumed all
SgInitializedName
were initializations of an explicit lhs with a rhs.  e.g. 'mInt(0)' below.

class Foo {
  Foo() : mInt(0);
  int mInt;
}
However, consider the case below where a SgInitializedName is initialized
by a
SgConstructorInitializer in a SgCtorInitializerLIst, as in SubClass below:

class SubSubClass : public SubClass {
   public:
      SubSubClass(Base &amp;par, int &amp;aint) : SubClass(par) { }
};

Here SubClass appears as a SgInitializedName within the AST.  However, it
is
not a variable, but rather represents the base class constructor.  So, in
fact,
the MRE that we create here will not be for a LHS, but for the implicit
this
actual argument that we pass as the first argument to SubClass
constructor.
        - Fixed [Bug #7962] Member fields, methods, and functions should
be non-local.
Details: ./CtoOA TestCases/AliasTests/parambinds-formals.C

    LOCATION = { &lt;
SymHandle(&quot;method:SubClass::SubClass____ct__FR4Base_v&quot;),
local &gt; }
    LOCATION = { &lt; SymHandle(&quot;this::SubClass::SubClass____ct__FR4Base_v&quot;),
local &gt; }
    LOCATION = { &lt; SymHandle(&quot;par&quot;), local &gt; }
    LOCATION = { &lt; SymHandle(&quot;myParent&quot;), local &gt; }

myParent and the method should not be local.

    LOCATION = { &lt; SymHandle(&quot;foo_ref1&quot;), local &gt; }

neither should foo_ref1.  Pretty much all methods, member vars, and
function
symbols should not be local.

Comment:
We were setting isLocal = true for all methods and functions in
getLocation.
The comment in those cases (V_SgFunctionDeclaration and
V_SgMemberFunctionDeclaration) is correct, but the flag was set
incorrectly, as
Michelle points out.
Fix:  simply set isLocal = false.
Added TestCase/CtoA/localNonLocal.c as a regression test for this bug.
        - Regenerated results for comma.c, constQualified.c,
functionPtr.c,
	  and functionPtr2.c (regressFIAliasAliasMap tests) and alias1.c,
	  alias2.c, alias4.c alias4b.c, and comma.c
(regressAliasIRInterface), all of which were affected by above isLocal
bug.
        - Moved invokeBaseCtor.C and localNonLocal tests to
	  AliasIRInterface.test and removed CtoOA.test
