<PRE>Hi all,

There are some subtle changes to how we do output in OpenAnalysis. I
think these changes, along with the motivation behind them, needs to
be documented (hence this e-mail). Here's a short summary if you don't
want to read straight-through my wall-of-text:

Summary:
  - Output builder can now add comments.

  - To use comments, some objects will have output methods that get
passed results.

  - Some objects now have comment() methods. These methods return a
succinct string for debugging purposes that aren't padded by
whitespace and contain no newlines.

 - Should we still have dump() methods?

 - Should the regression testing system ignore comments?

  - toString() methods in the IRHandlesInterface are now constant.
Priya, you'll have to update UseOA-Open64 to handle this.

Note: These changes are just in the alias tag branch for now.




Long explanation:

Output builder can now add comments:
-------------------------------------------------------

Michelle and I have been talking about adding a comment method to the
OutputBuilder class.

I think the output functions were originally developed to serialize
objects rather than to be a way of dumping debugging information --
the dump() functions were for that purpose.

One place we do use this output is in the regression tests. These
tests compare what we've specified as expected outputBuilder output
against actual output. In order to build a regression test one of us
has to hand check outputBuilder output. For our benefit it would be
convienent to include debugging info in this output.

Foe example: alias tag output. If you're outputting the result of a
data-flow analysis that propagates tags (such as liveness) you'd see
CFG nodes mapped to sets of tags. Each tag would output as such:

Tag(
    mTagID: 3
)

When verifying you'd have to check what set of MREs map to this tag
(meaning you'd have to cross reference each tag with the alias
analysis results). Doing this by hand for each and every tag would
become tedious fast. So we want to output the set of MREs along with
each tag.

But -- if we did this it would be poor output for serialization. Maybe
in the future we'll need to transmit objects across a network, put
them in a database, or save them to, then re-load them from, a file.
In which case we don't want any redundent or extraneous information.

The solution is to add comments to the output, showing what
information acuratly reflects the state of the object and what info is
there for our benefit. Comments work like you'd expect them to: ignore
everything right of #. So, with comments added the tag example
becomes:

Tag(
    mTagID: 8
    # NamedRef(g)
    # Deref(NamedRef(ptr))
)



To use comments, some objects will have output methods that get passed results.
-------------------------------------------------------

Alias tags don't themselves have Tag to MRE information, only the
alias-analysis result object does. So how do we get alias tags to
output their asscociated MREs?

Answer: we pass alias results into the output method. Note that the
alias tag class declares the following method:

virtual void output(OA::IRHandlesIRInterface&amp; ir,
                        const Interface&amp; aliasResults) const;

This means that any object that itself outputs alias tags needs to
have aliasResults info to call this function. To satisfy the
annotation interface the alias tag class also declares a version of
output without aliasResults.



Some objects now have comment() methods
-------------------------------------------------------

In particular all the classes in the MemRefExpr heirachy. Comment
methods are supposed to be methods that return a string for use in an
output comment. It's very important that these methods return a string
that does not include new-line characters!



Should the regression testing system ignore comments?
-------------------------------------------------------

Section title says it all. I think the following would do the trick:
  sed -e '/^[ \t]*#/d'



Should we still have dump() methods?
-------------------------------------------------------

Since our output() methods now include debugging info, do we still
need dump() methods? Seems sort of redundent, and whenever someone
updates a class with new functionality how do we ensure they update
both?



toString() methods from IRHandlesInterface are now constant
-------------------------------------------------------

Since these methods need to be called from the comment() methods in
the MemRefExpr classes, and these classes get passed a
constant-reference of an IRHandlesIterface. I've fixed UseOA-ROSE so
this is the case. We'll need to do the same for UseOA-Open64.
