<PRE>Hello everyone,

This past week, Paul, Priya, and Luis visited CSU.  Along with Shweta  
and Andy, we discussed various issues concerning OpenAnalysis.  See  
the OpenAnalysis wiki (<A HREF="http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/OpenAnalysisWiki/">http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/OpenAnalysisWiki/</A> 
moin.cgi/FrontPage) and look at pages OpenAnalysisMeeting and  
WhoIsDoingWhat.

1) The biggest issue we discussed was handling unspecified evaluation  
order within a statement.  The IRInterfaces are going to require a  
partial ordering between memory references and assignment pairs  
within a statement.  (Assignment pairs are currently called  
ExprStmtPairs, but we are changing the name for obvious reasons).

We will be going to a bit of work assuming that some languages might  
have unspecified evaluation orders.  To make sure that was the case I  
looked up some info on the C standard.  It appears that there are  
unspecified evaluation orders in the C programming language.  Paul,  
could you look at section 6.5 discussed below and help us understand  
what it is saying?

<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_programming_language">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_programming_language</A>
	Has a link to the C99 standard.
	6.5  I can't figure out how point 2 and point 3 get along.  Point 2  
seems to indicate that an object can only be updated once between  
sequence points, but point 3 says there is an unspecified evaluation  
and side-effect order.
	6.5.2.2 10 - No specified order for the evaluation of arguments to a  
function call.
	
<A HREF="http://www.andromeda.com/people/ddyer/topten.html">http://www.andromeda.com/people/ddyer/topten.html</A>
	See indefinite order of evaluation.  Seems that previous  
specifications of C also have the unspecified order of evaluation.

2) Jaewook's context sensitive activity analysis.  Jaewook, we need  
some help getting your algorithm to work with the concept of formal  
parameters modeled as pointers.  Also, we need some tests to add to  
our regression suite.

3) Intrinsics. Jean, please read the wiki about this issue, and we  
should discuss it next week.

4) AliasMap XAIF and UDDUChains XAIF.  Jean and I need to discuss  
what is expected here.

5) Some cleanup on the wiki.

Priya
- Clean up your entries in the wiki so that any names involving  
multiple capitals (MemRefExpr) are changed to Mem``Ref``Expr so that  
they don't show up as possible links to pages.

Luis
- Update the wiki with the assumptions you will be using for the  
current implementation of linearity.  Go ahead and leave the details  
you already have for later upgrades.
- Create another page to link off the WhoIsDoingWhat page that  
contains the pseudocode for your transfer function.
