<PRE>Hello all,

So that everyone is seeing more of the big picture, I have decided to  
send out a weekly status report that summarizes what got done last  
week, what the goals are for next week, and the current status on bugs.

======
July 3-7
======
This week was only a partial week due to the July 4th holiday.  Also,  
keep in mind that some folks are just getting up-to-speed.

Accomplishments for the week
-------------------------------------------
- Barbara added functionality to the CallGraph and tested that  
functionality in light of function ptrs.  She also helped Luis with  
Linearity Analysis understanding and found some bugs in the Linearity  
Paper. =)
- Luis fixed a newline problem we had in the DOT output builder and  
made good progress on the data structures needed for linearity analysis.
- Priya fixed ParamBindings and tested it.
- Brian fixed bugs 7962 and 7317 in UseOA-ROSE.
- Andy helped me implement isParam() in UseOA-ROSE.  He also created  
a branch MemRefExprComparisonChange to test the performance  
difference of OpenAnalysis upon his change to the comparison  
operators in Location and MemRefExpr.  Is this the right branch  
name?  Andy also added some notes on updating the OA web pages to the  
wiki.

Goals for this week
-------------------------------------------
- Barbara should aim to finish the ICFG construction that takes  
function ptrs into account and fix and test ManagerICFGDep.
- Luis should aim to have a driver that calls his linearity data  
structures with information that would be derived from the example in  
the paper.
- Priya is just starting at Argonne this week.  She should aim to  
have Side Effect analysis fixed and the html2latex stuff figured out.
- Brian would like to have the modeling of implicit constructor calls  
done by the end of the week, but it depends on some ROSE issues.
- Andy and I will be discussing his goals in an hour.

Plan for fixing Bugs
-------------------------------------------
- UseOA-ROSE #8092, Brian do you think you can fix the return problem  
this week?  Can we just comment out the assert as Andy did?
- UseOA-ROSE #8085, I aim to fix this one this week
- UseOA-ROSE #8082, Brian is working on this I think
- UseOA-ROSE #7964, Brian is working on this I think

- OA #8060, we are going to fix this with a refactor of the graph  
classes, looks like it doesn't show up on older g++ compilers.  For  
now just commenting out delete in OA_ptr.hpp
- OA #8068, Andy did you fix this one?
