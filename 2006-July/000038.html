<PRE>Hi,

I've just committed revision 111, though I decided to name it 110.

Would folks mind ending their ChangeLog entry with something that
indicates what version of ROSE and OpenAnalysis they used to pass
regressAll?  Like:

   - Passes regressAll using ROSE-0.8.7a and OpenAnalysis revision 139.

This revision fixes some things I am doing with the
staticVirtualMethodResolver and three bugs:

[Bug #8092] Return statements that don't return anything cause assertion
[Bug #8082] UnnamedRefs and PtrAssigns needed at string inits
[Bug #7964] Problems with var args

I've included the full bug reports in the ChangeLog below.

Thanks,
Brian

7/10/06  UseOA-Rose svn tag trunk r110 Brian White
    - Changes to staticVirtualMethodResolver
      - matchingMemberFunctions now compares a stringified version of
        two methods' return types, rather than the SgNode return types.
      - Changed &quot;accounting&quot; of number of possible virtual method
resolutions
	and a callsite-- a pure virtual method is no longer considered
        a possible resolution (since it can not be invoked).
        Is this correct?  Notice that an alias analysis would count
        this.  e.g., if Parent::foo() is pure virtual and Kid1::foo()
        and Kid2::foo() implement it, then an invocation of foo through
        a pointer has 2 possible resolutions, rather than 3.
    - Fixed [Bug #8092] Return statements that don't return anything cause
      assertion

      Details: Here is an example of where this happens.
      ./OATest -edg:w --oa-ParamBindings -c
TestCases/ParamBindings/qsort1.c
      Looks like the logic in SageIRInterface::getAliasStmtType needs
modified.

      Comment:

      An assertion in the V_SgReturnStmt case in
SageIRInterface::getAliasStmtType
      was failing.  I was asserting that the return expression from a
return
      statement was non-NULL.  This is not true for a void function.
Changed
      the assertion to an if.

      Passes qsort1.c
    - Fixed [Bug #8082] UnnamedRefs and PtrAssigns needed at string inits
      Details: When I run the following:
      ./CtoOA TestCases/AliasTests/passArrayPtr.c

      the following statement:
          char a[] = &quot;testing&quot;;
      gets only one MEMREFEXPR:
          MEMREFEXPRS = { StmtHandle(&quot;char a[] = &quot;testing&quot;;&quot;) =&gt;
              [
                  MemRefHandle(&quot;a&quot;) =&gt;
                      NamedRef( DEF, SymHandle(&quot;a&quot;), F, full)
              ] }
      There needs to be an UnnamedRef for the &quot;testing&quot; string and a
PtrAssign
      otherwise the alias analysis will have *a and anything that aliases
it
      access UnknownLoc.

      Comment:

      Added case in SageIRMemRefIterator::findAllMemRefsAndMemRefExprs to
      create a MemRefExpr for strings (case V_SgStringVal).  The
MemRefExpr so
      create mirrors that created for new/malloc-- it is inaccurate (since
we
      don't accurately model the statement context) and addressTaken =
true
      since it generates an address.

      To create the pointer assignment pair, changed conditional in
      SageIRInterface::initializerHasPtrAssign which returned false if the
      type of the lhs was not a pointer or reference so that it doesn't
return
      false if the lhs is an array (i.e., SgArrayType).

      ./CtoOA TestCases/AliasTests/passArrayPtr.c now gives the following
for
      the string case:

          MEMREFEXPRS = { StmtHandle(&quot;char a[] = &quot;testing&quot;;&quot;) =&gt;
              [
                  MemRefHandle(&quot;a&quot;) =&gt;
                      NamedRef( DEF, SymHandle(&quot;a&quot;), F, full)
                  MemRefHandle(&quot;&quot;testing&quot;&quot;) =&gt;
                      UnnamedRef( USE, StmtHandle(&quot;&quot;testing&quot;&quot;), T, part)
              ] }
          PTRASSIGNPAIRS = { StmtHandle(&quot;char a[] = &quot;testing&quot;;&quot;) =&gt;
              [
                  &lt; NamedRef( DEF, SymHandle(&quot;a&quot;), F, full)
                  , UnnamedRef( USE, StmtHandle(&quot;&quot;testing&quot;&quot;), T, part) &gt;
              ] }
    - passed passArrayPtr.c and added to regressAliasIRInterface
      to test above bug fix.
    - Fixed [Bug #7964] Problems with var args
      Details: ./CtoOA TestCases/AliasTests/parambinds-formals.C

          PARAMBINDPTRASSIGNPAIRS = {
CallHandle(&quot;ellipsis_intptrs(3,&amp;x,&amp;y,&amp;z)&quot;) =&gt;
              [
                  &lt; 2, NamedRef( USE, SymHandle(&quot;y&quot;), T, full) &gt;
                  &lt; 3, NamedRef( USE, SymHandle(&quot;z&quot;), T, full) &gt;
              ] }

      PROCEDURE = { &lt; ProcHandle(&quot;ellipsis_intptrs&quot;),
SymHandle(&quot;ellipsis_intptrs&quot;) &gt;
      }
          FORMALS = {
              [
                  &lt; 0, SymHandle(&quot;x&quot;) &gt;
                  &lt; 1, SymHandle(&quot;&quot;) &gt;
              ] }

      Two problems:
              1) where is &amp;x in the PARAMBINDPTRASSIGNPAIRS?
              2) bigger problem: the number of formals don't match the
number
                 of actuals

      Possible solutions for (2)
      Brian and Andy both suggested modeling this as passing in one
structure
      that contains everything.  This would merge everything being passed
in
      but I think that is ok.

                &lt; 1, NamedRef( USE, SymHandle(&quot;x&quot;), T, full) &gt;
                &lt; 1, NamedRef( USE, SymHandle(&quot;y&quot;), T, full) &gt;
                &lt; 1, NamedRef( USE, SymHandle(&quot;z&quot;), T, full) &gt;

      Comment:

      The first vararg was not being considered for
param-bind-ptr-assigns:
      We only create param bindings
      for pointers/references.  However, for var args we can
      not get the type from the formal, so we need to look at
      the actual.  SgParamBindPtrAssignIterator::create was
      correctly looking at the actual type in the formal was
      NULL or SgTypeEllipse.  Unfortunately, it would then
      set the type we are considering to the formal type
      anyway, if the we were not at the end of the formal
      list.  This only affected the first vararg, since
      at the second and subsequent varargs, we had
      reached/exceeded the end of the formal list
      and therefore could not get the type from it.

      Also assigned each actual corresponding
      to a vararg in the param-bind-ptr-assign-pairs
      to the same formal parameter number--
      namely the number corresponding to '...'.

      After this fix, we get 'x' listed in the
      param-bind-ptr-assign-pairs and have
      all actuals bound to formal 1:

          PARAMBINDPTRASSIGNPAIRS = {
CallHandle(&quot;ellipsis_intptrs(3,&amp;x,&amp;y,&amp;z)&quot;) =&gt;
              [
                  &lt; 1, NamedRef( USE, SymHandle(&quot;x&quot;), T, full) &gt;
                  &lt; 1, NamedRef( USE, SymHandle(&quot;y&quot;), T, full) &gt;
                  &lt; 1, NamedRef( USE, SymHandle(&quot;z&quot;), T, full) &gt;
              ] }

      This functionality is tested by parambinds-formals-intPtrs.C,
      which is a subset of parambinds-formals.C.
    - added parambinds-formals-intPtrs.C to test above bug fix.
    - Passes regressAll using ROSE-0.8.7a and OpenAnalysis revision 139.
