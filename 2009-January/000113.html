<PRE>Hello everyone,
thanks for the advice to use the SVN repository.. now I see a lot of 
useful things... expecially the MPI-CFG sub project! :)

Anyway, I want to explain what really are my needs and if anyone of you 
can help me with some pointer Iwilll really appreciate that. What I want 
to do (for my research) is practically program transformations. Take a 
parallel program as input (mainly MPI) and produce an optimized version 
as output. In order to write and apply transformation to programs I need 
to perform static analysis! The problem is that right now, none of the 
existing tools are suitable for me.

We need a frontend capable to parse C/C++ and Fortran source files. We 
looked inside ROSE... but we are encountering a lot of problems with the 
integrated analysis (bugs... slow...). I saw you claims that OA can be 
used with ROSE, where can I find informations about this? Furthermore we 
are considering other ways... we also looked inside the LLVM project, 
actually the Clang compiler, but as far it is a compiler, clang is not 
meant to be used as a source-to-source compiler. Probably the best 
option would be to work with the LLVM intermediate representation and I 
have heard that OA can be used also with the LLVM Bytecode. How can I 
get more details about the current status of integration?

many thanks,
regards Simone Pellegrini
